COULD NOT CLEAR missing-prop-type error passing props to CityItem.jsx. Looks like a configuration problem and I cannot find it.
Copied Lesson 212 complete from NEWworldwide final. Project now named FIX_worldiwide. Gonna start at lesson 213 - Implementing the cities list.

Lesson 213 - IMplementing the cities list is COMPLETE.  I think the problem was eslint misconfigured for VITE the first time I resoreted via GIT
becaus of an error I could not clear.
